abstract = {The Smart Grid (SG) is a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) considered a critical infrastructure divided into cyber (software) and physical (hardware) counterparts that complement each other. It is responsible for timely power provision wrapped by Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for handling bi-directional energy flows in electric power grids. Enacting control and performance over the massive infrastructure of the SG requires convenient analysis methods. Modelling and simulation (M&S) is a performance evaluation technique used to study virtually any system by testing designs and artificially creating â€˜what-if' scenarios for system reasoning and advanced analysis. M&S avoids stressing the actual physical infrastructure and systems in production by addressing the problem in a purely computational perspective. Present work compiles a non-exhaustive list of tools for M&S of interest when tackling SG capabilities. Our contribution is to delineate available options for modellers when considering power systems in combination with ICT. We also show the auxiliary tools and details of most relevant solutions pointing out major features and combinations over the years.},

abstract = {Using evolutionary computation algorithms to solve multiple tasks with knowledge sharing is a promising approach. Image feature learning can be considered as a multitask problem because different tasks may have a similar feature space. Genetic programming (GP) has been successfully applied to image feature learning for classification. However, most of the existing GP methods solve one task, independently, using sufficient training data. No multitask GP method has been developed for image feature learning. Therefore, this paper develops a multitask GP approach to image feature learning for classification with limited training data. Owing to the flexible representation of GP, a new knowledge sharing mechanism based on a new individual representation is developed to allow GP to automatically learn what to share across two tasks and to improve its learning performance. The shared knowledge is encoded as a common tree, which can represent the common/general features of two tasks. With the new individual representation, each task is solved using the features extracted from a common tree and a task-specific tree representing task-specific features. To learn the best common and task-specific trees, a new evolutionary process and new fitness functions are developed. The performance of the proposed approach is examined on six multitask problems of 12 image classification datasets with limited training data and compared with three GP and 14 non-GP-based competitive methods. Experimental results show that the new approach outperforms these compared methods in almost all the comparisons. Further analysis reveals that the new approach learns simple yet effective common trees with high effectiveness and transferability.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {Background: The presence of lymph node metastases is one of the most important factors in breast cancer prognosis. The most common way to assess regional lymph node status is the sentinel lymph node procedure. The sentinel lymph node is the most likely lymph node to contain metastasized cancer cells and is excised, histopathologically processed, and examined by a pathologist. This tedious examination process is time-consuming and can lead to small metastases being missed. However, recent advances in whole-slide imaging and machine learning have opened an avenue for analysis of digitized lymph node sections with computer algorithms. For example, convolutional neural networks, a type of machine-learning algorithm, can be used to automatically detect cancer metastases in lymph nodes with high accuracy. To train machine-learning models, large, well-curated datasets are needed. Results: We released a dataset of 1,399 annotated whole-slide images (WSIs) of lymph nodes, both with and without metastases, in 3 terabytes of data in the context of the CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 Grand Challenges. Slides were collected from five medical centers to cover a broad range of image appearance and staining variations. Each WSI has a slide-level label indicating whether it contains no metastases, macro-metastases, micro-metastases, or isolated tumor cells. Furthermore, for 209 WSIs, detailed hand-drawn contours for all metastases are provided. Last, open-source software tools to visualize and interact with the data have been made available. Conclusions: A unique dataset of annotated, whole-slide digital histopathology images has been provided with high potential for re-use.},

abstract = {During the past decade, with the significant progress of computational power as well as ever-rising data availability, deep learning techniques became increasingly popular due to their excellent performance on computer vision problems. The size of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has increased more than 15-fold since 1999, which enabled the expansion of models that aim at predicting enzymatic function via their amino acid composition. Amino acid sequence, however, is less conserved in nature than protein structure and therefore considered a less reliable predictor of protein function. This paper presents EnzyNet, a novel 3D convolutional neural networks classifier that predicts the Enzyme Commission number of enzymes based only on their voxel-based spatial structure. The spatial distribution of biochemical properties was also examined as complementary information. The two-layer architecture was investigated on a large dataset of 63,558 enzymes from the PDB and achieved an accuracy of 78.4% by exploiting only the binary representation of the protein shape.

abstract = {Neuroevolution is the field of study that uses evolutionary computation in order to optimize certain aspect of the design of neural networks, most often its topology and hyperparameters. The field was introduced in the late-1980s, but only in the latest years the field has become mature enough to enable the optimization of deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we rely on previous work to apply neuroevolution in order to optimize the topology of deep neural networks that can be used to solve the problem of handwritten character recognition. Moreover, we take advantage of the fact that evolutionary algorithms optimize a population of candidate solutions, by combining a set of the best evolved models resulting in a committee of convolutional neural networks. This process is enhanced by using specific mechanisms to preserve the diversity of the population. Additionally, in this paper, we address one of the disadvantages of neuroevolution: The process is very expensive in terms of computational time. To lessen this issue, we explore the performance of topology transfer learning: Whether the best topology obtained using neuroevolution for a certain domain can be successfully applied to a different domain. By doing so, the expensive process of neuroevolution can be reused to tackle different problems, turning it into a more appealing approach for optimizing the design of neural networks topologies. After evaluating our proposal, results show that both the use of neuroevolved committees and the application of topology transfer learning are successful: Committees of convolutional neural networks are able to improve classification results when compared to single models, and topologies learned for one problem can be reused for a different problem and data with a good performance. Additionally, both approaches can be combined by building committees of transferred topologies, and this combination attains results that combine the best of both approaches.},

Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we are exploring ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21:2% top-1 and 5:6% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters.

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women, affecting more than 10% of women worldwide. Microscopic analysis of a biopsy remains one of the most important methods to diagnose the type of breast cancer. This requires specialized analysis by pathologists, in a task that i) is highly time- and cost-consuming and ii) often leads to nonconsensual results. The relevance and potential of automatic classification algorithms using hematoxylin-eosin stained histopathological images has already been demonstrated, but the reported results are still sub-optimal for clinical use. With the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in automatic classification, the Grand Challenge on BreAst Cancer Histology images (BACH) was organized in conjunction with the 15th International Conference on Image Analysis and Recognition (ICIAR 2018). BACH aimed at the classification and localization of clinically relevant histopathological classes in microscopy and whole-slide images from a large annotated dataset, specifically compiled and made publicly available for the challenge. Following a positive response from the scientific community, a total of 64 submissions, out of 677 registrations, effectively entered the competition. The submitted algorithms improved the state-of-the-art in automatic classification of breast cancer with microscopy images to an accuracy of 87%. Convolutional neuronal networks were the most successful methodology in the BACH challenge. Detailed analysis of the collective results allowed the identification of remaining challenges in the field and recommendations for future developments. The BACH dataset remains publicly available as to promote further improvements to the field of automatic classification in digital pathology.},

Histopathological imaging is one of the methods for cancer diagnosis where Pathologists examine tissue cells under different microscopic standards but disagree on the final decision. This is a tiresome task and for that reason, Deep Neural Networks are being used for the supervised classification. We have used Breast Histology dataset having 240 training and 20 test images for classification of the histology images among four classes, i.e. Normal, Benign, In-situ carcinoma and Invasive carcinoma. The dataset was preprocessed for proper classification. We have applied transfer learning based on AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet that can classify images at multiple cellular and nuclei configurations. This approach has resulted in 85% accuracy in case of ResNet as the highest among others and further research is being done to increase its efficiency and reduce the human dependency. The proposed design can also be enhanced for automation of other medical imaging methods.},

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality in women. Early detection and treatment are imperative for improving sur- vival rates, which have steadily increased in recent years as a result of more sophisticated computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) systems.},

abstract = {Background: Several methodological approaches have been used to estimate distance in health service research. In this study, focusing on cardiac catheterization services, Euclidean, Manhattan, and the less widely known Minkowski distance metrics are used to estimate distances from patient residence to hospital. Distance metrics typically produce less accurate estimates than actual measurements, but each metric provides a single model of travel over a given network. Therefore, distance metrics, unlike actual measurements, can be directly used in spatial analytical modeling. Euclidean distance is most often used, but unlikely the most appropriate metric. Minkowski distance is a more promising method. Distances estimated with each metric are contrasted with road distance and travel time measurements, and an optimized Minkowski distance is implemented in spatial analytical modeling. Methods: Road distance and travel time are calculated from the postal code of residence of each patient undergoing cardiac catheterization to the pertinent hospital. The Minkowski metric is optimized, to approximate travel time and road distance, respectively. Distance estimates and distance measurements are then compared using descriptive statistics and visual mapping Methods: The optimized Minkowski metric is implemented, via the spatial weight matrix, in a spatial regression model identifying socio-economic factors significantly associated with cardiac catheterization. Results: The Minkowski coefficient that best approximates road distance is 1.54; 1.31 best approximates travel time. The latter is also a good predictor of road distance, thus providing the best single model of travel from patient's residence to hospital. The Euclidean metric and the optimal Minkowski metric are alternatively implemented in the regression model, and the results compared. The Minkowski method produces more reliable results than the traditional Euclidean metric. Conclusion: Road distance and travel time measurements are the most accurate estimates, but cannot be directly implemented in spatial analytical modeling. Euclidean distance tends to underestimate road distance and travel time; Manhattan distance tends to overestimate both. The optimized Minkowski distance partially overcomes their shortcomings; it provides a single model of travel over the network. The method is flexible, suitable for analytical modeling, and more accurate than the traditional metrics; its use ultimately increases the reliability of spatial analytical models. {\textcopyright} 2009 Shahid et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The explosion of image data on the Internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called "ImageNet", a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

@article{Flach2003,
abstract = {Many different metrics are used in machine learning and data mining to build and evaluate models. However, there is no general theory of machine learning metrics, that could answer questions such as: When we simultaneously want to optimise two criteria, how can or should they be traded off? Some metrics are inherently independent of class and misclassification cost distributions, while other are not - can this be made more precise? This paper provides a derivation of ROC space from first principles through 3D ROC space and the skew ratio, and redefines metrics in these dimensions. The paper demonstrates that the graphical depiction of machine learning metrics by means of ROC isometrics gives many useful insights into the characteristics of these metrics, and provides a foundation on which a theory of machine learning metrics can be built.},
