abstract = {The methods section of a research paper provides the information by which a study's validity is judged. Therefore, it requires a clear and precise description of how an experiment was done, and the rationale for why specific experimental procedures were chosen. The methods section should describe what was done to answer the research question, describe how it was done, justify the experimental design, and explain how the results were analyzed. Scientific writing is direct and orderly. Therefore, the methods section structure should: describe the materials used in the study, explain how the materials were prepared for the study, describe the research protocol, explain how measurements were made and what calculations were performed, and state which statistical tests were done to analyze the data. Once all elements of the methods section are written, subsequent drafts should focus on how to present those elements as clearly and logically as possibly. The description of preparations, measurements, and the protocol should be organized chronologically. For clarity, when a large amount of detail must be presented, information should be presented in sub-sections according to topic. Material in each section should be organized by topic from most to least important.},

abstract = {Many controlled systems suffer from unmodeled nonlinear effects that recur periodically over time. Model-free controllers generally cannot compensate these effects, and good physical models for such periodic dynamics are challenging to construct. We investigate nonparametric system identification for periodically recurring nonlinear effects. Within a Gaussian process (GP) regression framework, we use a locally periodic covariance function to shape the hypothesis space, which allows for a structured extrapolation that is not possible with more widely used covariance functions. We show that hyperparameter estimation can be performed online using the maximum a posteriori point estimate, which provides an accuracy comparable with sampling methods as soon as enough data to cover the periodic structure has been collected. It is also shown how the periodic structure can be exploited in the hyperparameter optimization. The predictions obtained from the GP model are then used in a model predictive control framework to correct the external effect. The availability of good continuous predictions allows control at a higher rate than that of the measurements. We show that the proposed approach is particularly beneficial for sampling times that are smaller than, but of the same order of magnitude as, the period length of the external effect. In experiments on a physical system, an electrically actuated telescope mount, this approach achieves a reduction of about 20% in root mean square tracking error.},
